# dcel

`dcel` is a Golang implementation of the doubly connected edge list (DCEL) data structure
and is used to represent planar graphs in a plane.

This implementation is intended to be used in 2D space only and was initially created for
use by the [voronoi package](https://github.com/quasoft/voronoi) for generation of voronoi diagrams with Fortune's algorithm.
